# GameOfLife
This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life where one can draw an initial state.

The game follows 4 rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

In order to get this working, draw with your cursor in the window, and then click play. You can play and stop between generations.

You can also click the reload button for new random patterns to start going through the phases of cellular automata.
